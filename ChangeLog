	* configure.in: Look for architecture-dependent files under exec_prefix
	  A recent change to fuse (d70e16cda5b272573220c2df4e52655447eee04e in
	  the grimoire) caused fuse to install architecture-dependent files to /
	  instead of /usr via the --exec-prefix (a.k.a. EPREFIX or exec_prefix)
	  configure flag.
	  Our castfs configure.in is checking for prefix (architecture-independent)
	  instead of exec_prefix (architecture_dependent). This change causes
	  castfs to look for libfuse.a (an architecture-dependent file) wherever
	  exec_prefix is defined, rather than the architecture-independent prefix.
