1. Add comments to code.	(in-work)
2. Add documentation.		(in-work; help welcome)
3. Fix smgl bugs.		(help welcom)
4. Recruit somebody capable of writing test code.
5. configure.in: ryuji had problems with FUSE_PREFIX being bad for static
	version.  I personally feel the static option should be removed, but
	would like input on this.	-D.E.Edmons

Design changes:
	1. Command line options and environment variables should have
		reasonable defaults.

		syntax:
			castfs <root> <mount point> [<stage directory>]
			castfs <root> <mount point> [<stage directory>]
				<root>	non-optional.
	2. Add --version option

David's old stuff:

 * test test test
 * benchmarking code
 * fix recusive stuff (check the mount directory and return error on accessing)
  might be better to implement a denied dirs list similar to ignored dirs accept  any access to these directories would result in error
 * it'd be nice to handle what gets removed while the process is going this 
  currently is held in memory and it'd be nice to have a list of files that got
  removed during the castfs process
 * debug log should have more stuff in it, it'd be nice to have some of the 
  output that strace has I'll have to investigate it.
